# Gameplay Loop
Start of day, no time limit, no enemy, cannot plant crops, use this time to build & prepare the farm
Morning - some basic projectile enemies spawn, energize player upon entering (encourage farm dev), when
the player leave the farm or when a camp is cleared, boost player speed (encourage exploration)
Alt Morning - a portal spawn, the player CAN plant at the start of day, the day officially start when the player enter the portal
Dungeoning - There are several dungeons to choose from, reaching the boss room & defeat will reward unique augments
At the start, spawn in one of the starting room of the dungeon
When in dungeon, a portal back to the farm might spawn, if taken, the next time the player enter this dungeon would be where the portal
is instead
If leave dungeon early, the player can go back to THAT dungeon again until night time approaches
Beware, if reentering when night time approaches, the player may not be able to come back to defend the garden?
Night time approaches - 10s before nightfall, some basic projectile enemies spawn
Afternoon - return to farm, harvest, replant & prepare for night raids
Night - Enemies spawn in waves, 
Dawn - Return to town, trade with NPC, buy seeds, gun, upgrades, blueprint, accepts quests for certain crops or challenges

## Portal 
Maybe choose from 3 random dungeons everyday
Dungeon will have a theme, mashed dungeon might spawn & give extra reward?


# Fantasy Goal
Big harvest (money go stonk!)
Big farm (screen zoom out as game/farm expand?)
Good looking farm (hard to achieve since runs are time limited)
- Allow building reconstruction refunds 100%
- greenhouse building for automatic harvesting & nearby decoration improve efficiency?
- reward decorating the farm with paths, buildings, & small decorations
- allow section off the farm for rewards (similar to Oxygen Not Included)

# Problem & Feature to improve from Atomicrops & Stardew
## Dodge roll -> allow for more bullet hell enemies & extreme enemy spawn & more skill expression
Compromise: Gun/Tool radial wheel instead of basic all-in-one farming actions & scroll to switch between seeds

## New problem: Game feel clunky
Weed wacking take an action & tool switch
Expand farm land take a holding action
Tiling soil take a holding action

For:
Expand farm land take a holding action
Tiling soil take a holding action
Solution:
Use Stardew Valley System: No need for pickaxe to expand farmland


## Efficient Farm =/= Nice looking farm
For efficient/convenient farming, farm tiles would be next to each other & road tiles/decoration will obstruct this

## Dungeoning is only for upgrades for the farm / Farming is more chill
HOW DO I SOLVE THIS?


## Limited farmland + Obstructing well -> Have a big (almost unlimited maybe) farmland
+ No time to make the farm look nice -> Start of day has no time limit
Compromise: The player will enter a portal to go to explore instead

## Farming is better than exploring later on (more risk, slightly better reward) -> ?
Solution 1: Have the few last days of the end game be farming only?
Solution 2: Permanent upgrade are replaced with overpowered consumable
(like your next 100 crops instantly grow when planted)

## Buff design space are limited
Since there are farming & combat stats, farming stat is useless inside dungeon
Also farming friends are < combat friends since they can't be inside the dungeon
And automation & buff are clashing with each other. I.e.
Seed scroll vs. seed planting speed & size upgrade
Same with tiling
Instant growth vs. growth buff
(instant growth can a strong consumable, but it depends on if the player invest on growth buff,
if it rare, then it is not reliable, if it is not, it devalues growth buff too much)

Solution 1: Guns have abilities attached to them, scaling with AP (new stat) & AD (split from combat stat)




# Quest Types
Here's the seeds, plant & harvest these crops before day (?)


# Farm Helpers
Horse - Use 5 to mount, dismount when use gun (melee does not dismount)
Water spirit - water plant
Pig - Till soil
